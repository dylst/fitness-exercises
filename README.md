## Description

While at the gym, I always found it cumbersome trying to remember the proper form to a workout when I was first starting out or trying a new exercise. Having to browse around for simply a quick reference took up the limited amount of time that I had at the gym, and trying to find another exercise that used the same equipment wasn't always the best experience. I decided to solve this problem by using my react skills to create this project, which has everything that I would need all in one place.

This project helped me learn how to:
- Leverage the power of React with functional components and hooks
- Create an optimal React folder and file structure
- Fetch and display data from an API
- The importance of hiding API keys in a .env file
- Create a Single Page Application using React Router
- Implement Pagination
- Make use of NPM React components such as react-horizontal-scrolling-menu
- Create a responsive UI using Material UI

## Built with
